Each word is compared to words in the database and if they're very similiar, Word underlines it and suggestion revision. Such function works for other languages as well such as Mandarin. For grammar check, I think Grammarly has their own neutral network models that check the syntax of sentences.\n",

    "### Your answer to Question 7\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part is using Python to print certain words from the text. Here when excuting $\\textit{inaug[:15]}$, the program prints the first 15 words in Inaugural Address Corpus. When excuting $\\textit{inaug[-15:]}$, it prints the last 15 words in the text. Same goes for $\\textit{genesis[:15]}$ and $\\textit{genesis[-15:]}$. The notation $\\textit{[x:y]}$ is returning the values from index $x$ to index $y$. If either $x,y$ is ignored, it becomes $0$. $x$ is always smaller than or equal to $y$, therefore we write $[:15]$ for $[0:15]$ and $[-15:]$ for $[-15,0]$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second nltk method is to print all the occurances of a specific word. When excuting $\\textit{inaug.concordance(\"people\")}$, the program returns all the places where $\\textit{people}$ is found, and the adjacent words/ context. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third nltk method is $\\textit{.similar()}$. This method returns other words in similar range as the target word. For example, when excuting $\\textit{inaug.similar(\"people\")}$, we get other words appear in a similar range of the contexts. Notice this result will differ depending on the context. That's why we see different result for $\\textit{inaug.similar(\"people\")}$ and $\\textit{genesis.similar(\"people\")}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next part we are counting how diverse the word usage is in a text. For example, $\\textit{len(set(genesis)) / len(genesis)}$ is printing how many non-repetitive words are used in genesis. $\\textit{set()}$ in Python creates a set of non-repetitive elements. When we have words with multiple occurences in text, it will become one occurance after the $\\textit{set()}$ operation/ function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, $\\textit{type}$ means non-repetitive words, while $\\textit{token}$ means every single word in the text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, tnlk $\\textit{.count()}$ returns how many times a certain word appears. When dividing by the tokens of the text (and then multiply by 100), we get the percentage of that word in the whole text. For example, $\\textit{100 * genesis.count('the') / len(genesis)}$ shows there are $5.38\\%$ tokens in the Genesis that is \"the\"."

    "\n",
    "$\\textit{Question 11, Ch 02}$ Investigate the table of modal distributions and look for other patterns. Try to explain them in terms of your own impressionistic understanding of the different genres. Can you find other closed classes of words that exhibit significant differences across different genres?\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the set of universal words for this question since life events such as \"death\", \"life\", \"marriage\" is universal to all genres included below. My expectation is that $\\textit{religious}$ text has more frequency of \"love\" compared to \"hate\", and it also will have more \"life\" because Bible gives us advice to solve incidents encounter in life. I also expect $\\textit{news}$ to have the highest occurence of \"death\" since many news reports are on accidents involving casualty. I suppose $\\textit{romance}$ should have more \"love\", \"hate\" and \"marriage\", as romance usually covers how two young people meet each other, fall in love and step into marriage. I expect $\\textit{sci_fi}$ to have more \"death\", \"life\" and \"work\" since the space is cruel and travellers are lonely in the space. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the results, most of my predictions aligns with the frequency distribution. I didn't expect that $\\textit{news}$ mentions \"work\" so frequently. I'm assuming they have reports about how restaurant owners, police and fire fighters work whenever there's an incident such as earthquake, protest, or mass power outrage. $\\textit{hobby}$ category also include much more \"work\" than I expected. I assume the \"work\" here refers to works of art or crafting. $\\textit{religion}$ contains more \"death\" than I expected. Considering the Bible and the resurrection of Jesus, it makes sense to me. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I find this conditional frequency distribution analysis very helpful in learning word usage of different genres. "

    "Let f(w) be the frequency of a word w in free text. Suppose that all the words of a text are ranked according to their frequency, with the most frequent word first. Zipf's law states that the frequency of a word type is inversely proportional to its rank (i.e. f × r = k, for some constant k). For example, the 50th most common word type should occur three times as frequently as the 150th most common word type.\n",
    "\n",
    "I find this question interesting as I read about Zipf's Law in the article analyzing the Voynich manuscript. Most natural langauge satisfy the Zipf's law and the frequency of a word is proptional to the inversion of $rank$. The graph I plotted below resembles the graph of $f(x)=1/x$ and thus demonstrated Zipf's Law exists for sci-fi text in nltk dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell, I plot the randomized text and the graph doesn't match the graph of $f(x)=1/x$. This is because random text do not exihibit the Zipf's Rank Distribution Law."
